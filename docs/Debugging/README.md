# Debugging notes

This folder contains short, chronological debugging logs for issues that required multiple attempts.

- Prefer appending to an existing log for the same issue.
- Keep entries concise and action-focused: what changed, where, expected impact, observed result.

## Workflow rule

- One log file per issue under `docs/Debugging/`.
- When the user says `olmadı` for the same issue, append a new entry to that issue log and immediately continue with the next attempt.
